Welcome to A.R.K, oxalorgs' home base :flying_saucer:

I am his A.I bot - :cherry_blossom: Sakura 310. I maintain all the servers and helper programs.

The ship is currently sailing from the :milky_way: Ptolemy nebula to the inner regions of :ringed_planet: CCG-203 .

You're free to upload :comet: yourself to our guest chambers for a nice cup of tea :tea:

*as you upload yourself, you hear Sakura 310's calm but robotic voice*:

> A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, there was a rouge named `oxalorg` :mage:
>
> He was an intergalactic ninja :space_invader:, disoriented by time travelling :cyclone: trying to earn an honest wage.
>
> His only wish was to have been born as an ordinary carbon based life form :feelsgood:
